# What is Makefile Maker

Makefile Maker is a GUI for making makefiles, it allows you to choose the executable name, sources files, source directory, header directory ...

The project is based on the marvelous works of clemedon, [Makefile tutor](https://github.com/clemedon/Makefile_tutor).

# How it works ?

You just need to put your data in the entry, and it will generate a Makefile that you can custom if you need.
